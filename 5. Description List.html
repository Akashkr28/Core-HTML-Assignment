        <dt><strong>HTML:</strong></dt>
        <dd>HTML (Hypertext Markup Language) is the most basic building block of the web. It defines the 
            meaning and structure of web content. Other technologies besides HTML are generally used to
            describe a web page appearance/presentation (CSS) or functionality/behavior (JavaScript).
            "Hypertext" refers to link that connect web pages to one another, either within a singlr website
            or between websites. HTML uses "markup" to annotate text, images, and other content for display
            in a Web Browser. HTML markup includes special "elements".</dd>
        <br>
        <dt><strong>CSS:</strong></dt>
        <dd>CSS (Cascading Style Sheet) is a stylesheet language used to describe the presentation of a
            document written in HTML or XML (including XML dialects such as SVG, MathML or XHTML). CSS describes
            how elements should be rendered on screen, on paper, in speech or on other media.</dd>
        <br>  
        <dt><strong>JavaScript:</strong></dt>
        <dd>JavaScript (JS) is a lighweight interpreted programming language with first-class function. While
            it is most well-known as the scripting language for Wb Pages, many non-browser environment also use 
            it. JavaScript is a prototype-based, multi-pardigm, single-threaded, dynamic language supporting 
            object-oriented, imperative and declarative styles.</dd>
        <br>
        <dt><strong>Node.js:</strong></dt>
        <dd>Node.js is a runtime environment that allows developers to use JavaScript on the server-side, 
            making it possible to build scalable and efficient server applications. It is an abstract base class upon
            which many other DOM API objects are based, thus letting those object types to be used similarly and
            often interchangeably.</dd>
        <br>
        <dt><strong>Express.js:</strong></dt>
        <dd>Express.js is a minimal and flexible Node.js web application framework that simplifies the 
            process of building robust and scalable web APIs and applications.</dd>
        <br>
        <dt><strong>React:</strong></dt>
        <dd>React is a JavaScript library for building user interfaces. It allows developers to create 
            reusable UI components for building interactive and single-page applications. React primary goal
            is to minimize the bugs that occur when developers are building UIs. Unlike the other framework
            covered in this module, React does not enforce strict rules around code conventions or file 
            organizations. This allows teams to set conventions that work best for them, and to adopt React
            in any way they would like to.</dd>
        <br>
        <dt><strong>Angular:</strong></dt>
        <dd>Angular is a comprehensive front-end framework for building dynamic web applications. It provides 
            a powerful structure for creating complex web apps with features like dependency injection and 
            two-way data binding.</dd>
        <br>
        <dt><strong>MongoDB:</strong></dt>
        <dd>MongoDB is a NoSQL database that stores data in a flexible, JSON-like format. It is often used 
            in full stack development to handle data storage and retrieval.</dd>
        <br>
        <dt><strong>SQL:</strong></dt>
        <dd>SQL (Structured Query Language) is a standard language for managing and querying relational 
            databases, making it essential for working with traditional databases like MySQL or PostgreSQL.</dd>
        <br>
        <dt><strong>GraphQL:</strong></dt>
        <dd>GraphQL is a query language for APIs that allows clients to request exactly the data they need, 
            reducing over-fetching and under-fetching of data in web applications.</dd>
        <br>
        <dt><strong>Docker:</strong></dt>
        <dd>Docker is a containerization platform that simplifies the deployment and management of web 
            applications by packaging them and their dependencies into containers.</dd>
        <br>
        <dt><strong>Kubernetes:</strong></dt>
        <dd>Kubernetes is an orchestration platform for managing containerized applications at scale, 
            providing features like load balancing, scaling, and self-healing.</dd>
